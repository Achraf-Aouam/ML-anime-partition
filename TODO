Future improvements to consider for model definition:

Add residual connections
Multi-scale feature extraction
Attention mechanisms
Label smoothing
Auxiliary tasks/losses

"""
TODO List - Future Improvements:
1. Model Architecture:
   - Add residual connections to GRU
   - Multi-head attention layer after GRU
   - Add auxiliary classification task (e.g., scene change detection)
   - Try different backbones (EfficientNet, ConvNext)
   - Add frame difference features

2. Training:
   - Implement mixed precision training
   - Curriculum learning (start with easy examples)
   - Cross-validation 
   - Learning rate finder
   - Test time augmentation
   - Model ensemble

3. Data:
   - More aggressive augmentation
   - Frame difference/optical flow
   - Scene transition detection
   - Additional metadata features
