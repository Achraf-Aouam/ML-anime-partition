Future improvements to consider for model definition:

Add residual connections
Multi-scale feature extraction
Attention mechanisms
Label smoothing
Auxiliary tasks/losses

"""
TODO List - Future Improvements:
1. Model Architecture:
   - Add residual connections to GRU
   - Multi-head attention layer after GRU
   - Add auxiliary classification task (e.g., scene change detection)
   - Try different backbones (EfficientNet, ConvNext)
   - Add frame difference features

2. Training:
   - Implement mixed precision training
   - Curriculum learning (start with easy examples)
   - Cross-validation 
   - Learning rate finder
   - Test time augmentation
   - Model ensemble

3. Data:
   - More aggressive augmentation
   - Frame difference/optical flow
   - Scene transition detection
   - Additional metadata features

For your TODO list of future improvements:

Consider using gradient clipping to prevent explosion
Implement learning rate finder to optimize initial learning rate
Add label smoothing to the loss function for better generalization
Consider using cosine annealing with warm restarts instead of OneCycleLR
Add model weight initialization strategy
Implement cross-validation for more robust evaluation
Add data augmentation (temporal and spatial)
Consider using a transformer encoder after the GRU
Add model ensemble capability
Implement test-time augmentation
